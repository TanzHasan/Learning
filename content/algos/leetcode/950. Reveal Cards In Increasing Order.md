Day 7: https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order/description/
Whoops I forgot to write solution here but I solved it in time to keep the streak going.

No hint because daily is technically over.

Explanation:

This one was interesting. I simulated the positions of how I wanted everything to be ordered and where they would end up. Indexes of the numbers are stored in a deque and I just simulate what it would be like to remove everything.

Let's say I have [0,1,2]. If I remove the top then it becomes [2, 1] because 1 gets put on the back. Then [1], then []. This gives us the ordering [0,2,1] so if we want everything in order aka 0 1 2, we will map the current positions of the number to the new ordering. We do this because the new ordering shows which positions will actually come first.

If we have [4,5,6] we can map that as well and see that we get the following ordering [4,6,5]. We can just simulate on this to see we have the right answer.


Easy to read code
||```python
class Solution:
    def deckRevealedIncreasing(self, deck: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        positions = deque([i for i in range(len(deck))])
        deck.sort()
        ans = [0]* len(deck)
        for i in range(len(deck)):
            pos = positions.popleft()
            ans[pos] = deck[i]
            if positions:
                positions.append(positions.popleft())
        return ans
```

Unhinged one liner from a friend:
```python
    def deckRevealedIncreasing(self, deck: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return res if (res := deque()) or [(res.rotate(), res.appendleft(c)) for c in sorted(deck, reverse=True)] else []
```
