Day 2:

Here is the question for today: https://leetcode.com/problems/make-the-string-great/

Here is a hint for the daily:

ABba produces an empty string. the reason for this is Bb turns to an empty string leaving Aa. Aa also turns into an empty string. How can we simulate that functionality and remove from the middle fast.

You can use a stack. We put A onto the stack, then B, then when we try and put b we see the case is different so we pop B off instead, then we try to put a and we see A so we pop A off as well.

Easy to read python solution
```python
class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for i in s:
            if stack and (stack[-1] == i.swapcase()):
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(i)
        return ''.join(stack)
```

one liner from a friend
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string makeGood(string s, vector<char> stk = {}) {
        return for_each(s.begin(),s.end(),[&s,&stk](char c){ !stk.empty() && abs(stk.back() - c) == 32 ? stk.pop_back() : stk.push_back(c); }), string(stk.begin(),stk.end());
    }
};
```
