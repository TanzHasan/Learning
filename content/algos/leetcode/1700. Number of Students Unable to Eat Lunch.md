Day 5:

Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-unable-to-eat-lunch/

Try and get a solution more clever than the obvious one.

Hint: 

What changes in the problem?  What could make it so people go hungry?

The position of the top sandwich will never change unless taken. So, as long as there is more than one of that type of student we are fine. People will only go hungry if we run out of a certain type of sandwich enjoyer and that sandwich is at the top 

Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def countStudents(self, students: List[int], sandwiches: List[int]) -> int:
        prefs = [sum(students)]
        prefs.insert(0, len(students) - prefs[-1])
        for i, num in enumerate(sandwiches):
            prefs[num]-=1
            if prefs[num] < 0:
                return len(sandwiches)-i
        return 0
```
