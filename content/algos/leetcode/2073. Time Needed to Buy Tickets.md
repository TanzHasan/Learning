Day 6: https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-buy-tickets/

Try and solve this better than just simulating.

How many times will the people in front of index k have gone by the time that index k is emptied. How many times will the people after have gone?

The answer is as many times as possible less than tickets[k] for the first group and as many times as possible less than tickets[k]-1 for the second

One-liner
```python
class Solution:
    def timeRequiredToBuy(self, tickets: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        return sum(min(tickets[i], tickets[k] - (i > k)) for i in range(len(tickets)))
```
